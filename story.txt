~ SETTING/BACKGROUND ~

The protag saw a billboard stating "TAKE A BREAK FROM THE COLLAPSE OF HUMANITY!! Relaxing lakeside cottage".
They investigate the offer, but still feel the omnipresent collapse of humanity.
During their stay, they take up the hobby of building little robots out of scrap to liven the place up.
