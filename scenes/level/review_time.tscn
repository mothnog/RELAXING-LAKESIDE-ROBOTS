For real– Relaxing Lakeside Cottages presents itself as an escape to a world detached from the problems of ours, but being a product of this world, it only exemplifies them. In this hectic landscape, I often don't know where I'm meant to be, and well, I suppose this experience ruled out one option! 

On the other hand, in the deteriorated state I found it in, I had the opportunity to nourish it with the presence of my bird friend. It’s nice to be reassured that even something made with so little care can be given new purpose in some shape or form. Surprisingly, my experience turned out way more meaningful than any manufactured feeling of comfort it was originally hoping to provide. (If it was ever trying to be anything at all…..)

i give [rating] stars, however birds get 5 stars
